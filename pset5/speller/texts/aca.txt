        requirements of this paragraph if such pool--
                    (A) provides to all eligible individuals health 
                insurance coverage that does not impose any preexisting 
                condition exclusion with respect to such coverage;

                          (i) in which the issuer's share of the total 
                      allowed costs of benefits provided under such 
                      coverage is not less than 65 percent of such

                      1986 for the year involved, except that the 
                      Secretary may modify such limit if necessary to

                rate shall--
                          (i) except as provided in clause (ii), vary 
                      only as provided for under section 2701 of the 
                      Public Health Service Act (as amended by this Act 
                      and notwithstanding the date on which such 
                      amendments take effect);

        lawfully present in the United States (as determined in 
        accordance with section 1411);
            (2) has not been covered under creditable coverage (as 
        defined in section 2701(c)(1) of the Public Health Service Act 
        as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) during the 6-
        month period prior to the date on which such individual is 
        applying for coverage through the high risk pool; and
            (3) has a pre-existing condition, as determined in a manner 
        consistent with guidance issued by the Secretary.

    (e) Protection Against Dumping Risk by Insurers.--
            (1) In general.--The <<NOTE: Criteria.>> Secretary shall 
        establish criteria for determining whether health insurance 
        issuers and employment-based health plans have discouraged an 
        individual from remaining enrolled in prior coverage based on 
        that individual's health status.
            (2) Sanctions.--An issuer or employment-based health plan 
        shall be responsible for reimbursing the program under this 
        section for the medical expenses incurred by the program for an 
        individual who, based on criteria established by the Secretary, 
        the Secretary finds was encouraged by the issuer to disenroll 
        from health benefits coverage prior to enrolling in coverage 
        through the program. The criteria shall include at least the 
        following circumstances:
                    (A) In the case of prior coverage obtained through 
                an employer, the provision by the employer, group health 
                plan, or the issuer of money or other financial 
                consideration for disenrolling from the coverage.
                    (B) In the case of prior coverage obtained directly 
                from an issuer or under an employment-based health 
                plan--
                          (i) the provision by the issuer or plan of 
                      money or other financial consideration for 
                      disenrolling from the coverage; or
                          (ii) in the case of an individual whose 
                      premium for the prior coverage exceeded the 
                      premium required by the program (adjusted based on 
                      the age factors applied to the prior coverage)--
                                    (I) the prior coverage is a policy 
                                that is no longer being actively 
                                marketed (as defined by the Secretary) 
                                by the issuer; or
                                    (II) the prior coverage is a policy 
                                for which duration of coverage form 
                                issue or health status are factors that 
                                can be considered in determining 
                                premiums at renewal.
            (3) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        construed as constituting exclusive remedies for violations of 
        criteria established under paragraph (1) or as preventing States

[[Page 124 STAT. 143]]

        from applying or enforcing such paragraph or other provisions 
        under law with respect to health insurance issuers.

    (f) Oversight.--The Secretary shall establish--
            (1) an appeals process to enable individuals to appeal a 
        determination under this section; and
            (2) procedures to protect against waste, fraud, and abuse.

    (g) Funding; Termination of Authority.--
            (1) In general.--There is appropriated to the Secretary, out 
        of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, 
        $5,000,000,000 to pay claims against (and the administrative 
        costs of) the high risk pool under this section that are in 
        excess of the amount of premiums collected from eligible 
        individuals enrolled in the high risk pool. Such funds shall be 
        available without fiscal year limitation.
            (2) Insufficient funds.--If the Secretary estimates for any 
        fiscal year that the aggregate amounts available for the payment 
        of the expenses of the high risk pool will be less than the 
        actual amount of such expenses, the Secretary shall make such 
        adjustments as are necessary to eliminate such deficit.
            (3) Termination of authority.--
                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), coverage of eligible individuals under a high risk 
                pool in a State shall terminate on January 1, 2014.
                    (B) Transition <<NOTE: Procedures.>> to exchange.--
                The Secretary shall develop procedures to provide for 
                the transition of eligible individuals enrolled in 
                health insurance coverage offered through a high risk 
                pool established under this section into qualified 
                health plans offered through an Exchange. Such 
                procedures shall ensure that there is no lapse in 
                coverage with respect to the individual and may extend 
                coverage after the termination of the risk pool 
                involved, if the Secretary determines necessary to avoid 
                such a lapse.
            (4) Limitations.--The Secretary has the authority to stop 
        taking applications for participation in the program under this 
        section to comply with the funding limitation provided for in 
        paragraph (1).
            (5) Relation to state laws.--The standards established under 
        this section shall supersede any State law or regulation (other 
        than State licensing laws or State laws relating to plan 
        solvency) with respect to qualified high risk pools which are 
        established in accordance with this section.

            (1) Employment-based plan eligibility.--A participating 
        employment-based plan is an employment-based plan that--
                    (A) meets the requirements of paragraph (2) with 
                respect to health benefits provided under the plan; and
                    (B) submits to the Secretary an application for 
                participation in the program, at such time, in such 
                manner, and containing such information as the Secretary 
                shall require.
            (2) Employment-based health benefits.--An employment-based 
        plan meets the requirements of this paragraph if the plan--
                    (A) implements programs and procedures to generate 
                cost-savings with respect to participants with chronic 
                and high-cost conditions;
                    (B) provides documentation of the actual cost of

                plan shall submit claims for reimbursement to the 
                Secretary which shall contain documentation of the 
                actual costs of the items and services for which each 
                claim is being submitted.
                    (B) Basis for claims.--Claims submitted under 
                subparagraph (A) shall be based on the actual amount 
                expended by the participating employment-based plan 
                involved within the plan year for the health benefits 
                provided to an early retiree or the spouse, surviving 
                spouse, or dependent of such retiree. In determining the 
                amount of a claim for purposes of this subsection, the 
                participating

[[Page 124 STAT. 145]]

                employment-based plan shall take into account any 
                negotiated price concessions (such as discounts, direct 
                or indirect subsidies, rebates, and direct or indirect 
                remunerations) obtained by such plan with respect to 
                such health benefit. For purposes of determining the 
                amount of any such claim, the costs paid by the early 
                retiree or the retiree's spouse, surviving spouse, or 
                dependent in the form of deductibles, co-payments, or 
                co-insurance shall be included in the amounts paid by 
                the participating employment-based plan.
            (2) Program payments.--If the Secretary determines that a 
        participating employment-based plan has submitted a valid claim 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall reimburse such plan for 
        80 percent of that portion of the costs attributable to such 
        claim that exceed $15,000, subject to the limits contained in 
        paragraph (3).
            (3) Limit.--To be eligible for reimbursement under the 
        program, a claim submitted by a participating employment-based 
        plan shall not be less than $15,000 nor greater than $90,000. 
        Such amounts shall be adjusted each fiscal year based on the 
        percentage increase in the Medical Care Component of the 
        Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (rounded to the 
        nearest multiple of $1,000) for the year involved.
            (4) Use of payments.--Amounts paid to a participating 
        employment-based plan under this subsection shall be used to 
        lower costs for the plan. Such payments may be used to reduce 
        premium costs for an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) 
        or to reduce premium contributions, co-payments, deductibles, 
        co-insurance, or other out-of-pocket costs for plan 
        participants. Such payments shall not be used as general 
        revenues for an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i). The 
        Secretary shall develop a mechanism to monitor the appropriate 
        use of such payments by such entities.
            (5) Payments not treated as income.--Payments received under 
        this subsection shall not be included in determining the gross 
        income of an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) that is 
        maintaining or currently contributing to a participating 
        employment-based plan.
            (6) Appeals.--The Secretary shall establish--
                    (A) an appeals process to permit participating 
                employment-based plans to appeal a determination of the 
                Secretary with respect to claims submitted under this 
                section; and
                    (B) procedures to protect against fraud, waste, and 
                abuse under the program.

    (d) Audits.--The Secretary shall conduct annual audits of claims 
data submitted by participating employment-based plans under this 
section to ensure that such plans are in compliance with the 
requirements of this section.

moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000,000 to 
carry out the program under this section. Such funds shall be available

                against their wishes on the basis of the individuals' 
                age or expected length of life or of the individuals'

                      relationship with the plan

[[Page 124 STAT. 165]]

                      for the providing of services that is more

                      that apply to emergency department services 
                      received from providers who do have such a 
                      contractual relationship with the plan; and
                          (ii) if such services are provided out-of-
                      network, the cost-sharing requirement (expressed 
                      as a copayment amount or coinsurance rate) is the 
                      same requirement that would apply if such services 
                      were provided in-network;
                    (F) provide that if a plan described in section 
                1311(b)(2)(B)(ii) (relating to stand-alone dental 
                benefits plans) is offered through an Exchange, another 
                health plan offered through such Exchange shall not fail 
                to be treated as a qualified health plan solely because 
                the plan does not offer coverage of benefits offered 
                through the stand-alone plan that are otherwise required 
                under paragraph (1)(J); and
                    (G) periodically review the essential health 
                benefits under paragraph (1), and provide a report to 
                Congress and the public that contains--
                          (i) an assessment of whether enrollees are 
                      facing any difficulty accessing needed services 
                      for reasons of coverage or cost;
                          (ii) an assessment of whether the essential 
                      health benefits needs to be modified or updated to 
                      account for changes in medical evidence or 
                      scientific advancement;
                          (iii) information on how the essential health 
                      benefits will be modified to address any such gaps 
                      in access or changes in the evidence base;
                          (iv) an assessment of the potential of 
                      additional or expanded benefits to increase costs 
                      and the interactions between the addition or 
                      expansion of benefits and reductions in existing 
                      benefits to meet actuarial limitations described 
                      in paragraph (2); and
                    (H) periodically update the essential health 
                benefits under paragraph (1) to address any gaps in 
                access to coverage or changes in the evidence base the 
                Secretary identifies in the review conducted under 
                subparagraph (G).
            (5) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this title shall be 
        construed to prohibit a health plan from providing benefits in 
        excess of the essential health benefits described in this 
        subsection.

    (c) Requirements Relating to Cost-Sharing.--
            (1) Annual limitation on cost-sharing.--
                    (A) 2014.--The cost-sharing incurred under a health

[[Page 124 STAT. 166]]

                          (i) in the case of self-only coverage, be 
                      equal to the dollar amount under subparagraph (A) 
                      for self-only coverage for plan years beginning in 
                      2014, increased by an amount equal to the product 
                      of that amount and the premium adjustment 
                      percentage under paragraph (4) for the calendar 
                      year; and
                          (ii) in the case of other coverage, twice the 
                      amount in effect under clause (i).
                If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a 
                multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the 
                next lowest multiple of $50.
            (2) Annual limitation on deductibles for employer-sponsored 
        plans.--
                    (A) In general.--In the case of a health plan 
                offered in the small group market, the deductible under 
                the plan shall not exceed--
                          (i) $2,000 in the case of a plan covering a 
                      single individual; and
                          (ii) $4,000 in the case of any other plan.
                The amounts under clauses (i) and (ii) may be increased 
                by the maximum amount of reimbursement which is 
                reasonably available to a participant under a flexible 
                spending arrangement described in section 106(c)(2) of 
                the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (determined without 
                regard to any salary reduction arrangement).
                    (B) Indexing of limits.--In the case of any plan 
                year beginning in a calendar year after 2014--
                          (i) the dollar amount under subparagraph 
                      (A)(i) shall be increased by an amount equal to 
                      the product of that amount and the premium 
                      adjustment percentage under paragraph (4) for the 
                      calendar year; and
                          (ii) the dollar amount under subparagraph 
                      (A)(ii) shall be increased to an amount equal to 
                      twice the amount in effect under subparagraph 
                      (A)(i) for plan years beginning in the calendar 
                      year, determined after application of clause (i).
                If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a 
                multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the 
                next lowest multiple of $50.
                    (C) Actuarial value.--The limitation under this 
                paragraph shall be applied in such a manner so as to not 
                affect the actuarial value of any health plan, including 
                a plan in the bronze level.
                    (D) Coordination with preventive limits.--Nothing in 
                this paragraph shall be construed to allow a plan to 
                have a deductible under the plan apply to benefits 
                described in section 2713 of the Public Health Service 
                Act.
            (3) Cost-sharing.--In this title--
                    (A) In general.--The term ``cost-sharing'' 
                includes--
                          (i) deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or 
                      similar charges; and
                          (ii) any other expenditure required of an 
                      insured individual which is a qualified medical 
                      expense (within the meaning of section 223(d)(2) 
                      of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) with respect 
                      to essential health benefits covered under the

                    (B) Exceptions.--Such term does not include 
                premiums, balance billing amounts for non-network 
                providers, or spending for non-covered services.
            (4) Premium <<NOTE: Determination. Deadline.>> adjustment 
        percentage.--For purposes of paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and (2)(B)(i), 
        the premium adjustment percentage for any calendar year is the 
        percentage (if any) by which the average per capita premium for 
        health insurance coverage in the United States for the preceding 
        calendar year (as estimated by the Secretary no later than 
        October 1 of such preceding calendar year) exceeds such average 
        per capita premium for 2013 (as determined by the Secretary).

    (d) Levels of Coverage.--
            (1) Levels of coverage defined.--The levels of coverage 
        described in this subsection are as follows:
                    (A) Bronze level.--A plan in the bronze level shall 
                provide a level of coverage that is designed to provide 
                benefits that are actuarially equivalent to 60 percent 
                of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided 
                under the plan.
                    (B) Silver level.--A plan in the silver level shall 
                provide a level of coverage that is designed to provide

                of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided 
                under the plan.
                    (C) Gold level.--A plan in the gold level shall 
                provide a level of coverage that is designed to provide 
                benefits that are actuarially equivalent to 80 percent 
                of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided

            (2) Actuarial value.--
                    (A) In general.--Under regulations issued by the 
                Secretary, the level of coverage of a plan shall be 
                determined on the basis that the essential health 
                benefits described in subsection (b) shall be provided 
                to a standard population (and without regard to the 
                population the plan may actually provide benefits to).
                    (B) Employer contributions.--The Secretary may issue 
                regulations under which employer contributions to a 
                health savings account (within the meaning of section 
                223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) may be taken 
                into account in determining the level of coverage for a 
                plan of the employer.
                    (C) Application.--In determining under this title, 
                the Public Health Service Act, or the Internal Revenue 
                Code of 1986 the percentage of the total allowed costs 
                of benefits provided under a group health plan or health 
                insurance coverage that are provided by such plan or 
                coverage, the rules contained in the regulations under 
                this paragraph shall apply.
            (3) Allowable variance.-- <<NOTE: Guidelines.>> The 
        Secretary shall develop guidelines to provide for a de minimis 
        variation in the actuarial valuations used in determining the 
        level of coverage of a plan to account for differences in 
        actuarial estimates.

[[Page 124 STAT. 168]]

            (4) Plan reference.--In this title, any reference to a 
        bronze, silver, gold, or platinum plan shall be treated as a 
        reference to a qualified health plan providing a bronze, silver, 
        gold, or platinum level of coverage, as the case may be.

                      essential health benefits determined under 
                      subsection (b), except that the plan provides no 
                      benefits for any plan year until the individual 
                      has incurred cost-sharing expenses in an amount 
                      equal to the annual limitation in effect under 
                      subsection (c)(1) for the plan year (except as 
                      provided for in section 2713); and
                          (ii) coverage for at least three primary care 
                      visits.
            (2) Individuals eligible for enrollment.--An individual is

                beginning of the plan year; or
                    (B) has a certification in effect for any plan year 
                under this title that the individual is exempt from the 
                requirement under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue 
                Code of 1986 by reason of--

                      option. Services described in subparagraph (B)(ii)

                      services are covered under title XIX of the Social 
                      Security Act.
                    (D) Assured availability of varied coverage through

                                that provides coverage of services

                segregate an amount equal to the actuarial amounts

                          (ii) Considerations.--In making such estimate,

                                on overall costs of the inclusion of 
                                such coverage, but may not take into 
                                account any cost reduction estimated

[[Page 124 STAT. 171]]

                                to result from such services, including 
                                prenatal care, delivery, or postnatal

                                    (II) shall estimate such costs as if

        <<NOTE: Abortions.>> No individual health care provider or

        willingness or an unwillingness, if doing so is contrary to the 
        religious or moral beliefs of the provider or facility, to 
        provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.

    (b) Application of State and Federal Laws Regarding Abortion.--

                    (A) meet marketing requirements, and not employ 
                marketing practices or benefit designs that have the 
                effect of discouraging the enrollment in such plan by 
                individuals with significant health needs;
                    (B) ensure a sufficient choice of providers (in a

                provisions under section 2702(c) of the Public Health 
                Service Act), and provide information to enrollees and

                that serve predominately low-income, medically-

                defined in section 340B(a)(4) of the Public Health 
                Service Act and providers described in section

                forth by section 221 of Public Law 111-8, except that 
                nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to 
                require any health plan to provide coverage for any 
                specific medical procedure;
                    (D)(i) be accredited with respect to local 
                performance on clinical quality measures such as the

                patient experience ratings on a standardized Consumer 
                Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, 
                as well as consumer access, utilization management, 
                quality assurance, provider credentialing, complaints 
                and appeals, network adequacy and access, and patient 
                information programs by any entity recognized by the 
                Secretary for the accreditation of health insurance 
                issuers or plans (so long as any such entity has 
                transparent and rigorous methodological and scoring 
                criteria); or
                    (ii) receive such accreditation within a period 
                established by an Exchange for such accreditation that 
                is applicable to all qualified health plans;
                    (E) implement a quality improvement strategy 
                described in subsection (g)(1);
                    (F) utilize a uniform enrollment form that qualified 
                individuals and qualified employers may use (either 
                electronically or on paper) in enrolling in qualified 
                health plans offered through such Exchange, and that 
                takes into account criteria that the National 
                Association of Insurance Commissioners develops and 
                submits to the Secretary;
                    (G) utilize the standard format established for

                enrollees, and to each Exchange in which the plan is 
                offered, on any quality measures for health plan 
                performance endorsed under section 399JJ of the Public 
                Health Service Act, as applicable.

[[Page 124 STAT. 175]]

            (2) Rule of construction.-- <<NOTE: Contracts.>> Nothing in 
        paragraph (1)(C) shall be construed to require a qualified

        paragraph if such provider refuses to accept the generally 
        applicable payment rates of such plan.
            (3) Rating system.--The Secretary shall develop a rating 
        system that would rate qualified health plans offered through an 
        Exchange in each benefits level on the basis of the relative 
        quality and price. The Exchange shall include the quality rating 
        in the information provided to individuals and employers through 
        the Internet portal established under paragraph (4).
            (4) Enrollee satisfaction system.--The Secretary shall 
        develop an enrollee satisfaction survey system that would

                exclude a health plan--

                eligible for 1 or more qualified health plans offered in 
                the small group market through an Exchange that offers

                      market in the State to offer qualified health 
                      plans in such market through an Exchange. Nothing 
                      in this subparagraph shall be construed as 
                      requiring the issuer to offer such plans through 
                      an Exchange.
                          (ii) Large employers eligible.--If a State 
                      under clause (i) allows issuers to offer qualified 
                      health plans in the large group market through an

                      include a large employer that elects to make all 
                      full-time employees of such employer eligible for

        the individual shall not be treated as a qualified individual 
        and may not be covered under a qualified health plan in the 
        individual market that is offered through an Exchange.

                Claims Act on any person found liable under such Act as

                less than 3 times and not more than 6 times the amount 
                of damages which the Government sustains because of the 
                act of that person.

    (b) GAO Oversight. <<NOTE: Deadline. Study.>> --Not later than 5

        insurance coverage outside of Exchanges), the expenses of 
        Exchanges, claims statistics relating to qualified health plans, 
        complaints data relating to such plans, and the manner in which

        shall, as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, issue regulations setting standards for meeting the 
        requirements under this title, and the amendments made by this 
        title, with respect to--

                adjustment programs under part V; and
                    (D) such other requirements as the Secretary 
                determines appropriate.
        The preceding sentence shall not apply to standards for 
        requirements under subtitles A and C (and the amendments made by

        the Public Health Service Act.
            (2) Consultation.--In issuing the regulations under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with the National 
        Association of Insurance Commissioners and its members and with

        or
            (2) a State law or regulation that the Secretary determines 
        implements the standards within the State.

    (c) Failure To Establish Exchange or Implement Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--If--
                    (A) a State is not an electing State under 
                subsection (b); or
                    (B) <<NOTE: Determination. Deadline.>> the Secretary 
                determines, on or before January 1, 2013, that an 
                electing State--
                          (i) will not have any required Exchange 
                      operational by January 1, 2014; or
                          (ii) has not taken the actions the Secretary 
                      determines necessary to implement--
                                    (I) the other requirements set forth 
                                in the standards under subsection (a);

                                made by such subtitles;
        the Secretary shall (directly or through agreement with a not-
        for-profit entity) establish and operate such Exchange within 
        the State and the Secretary shall take such actions as are 
        necessary to implement such other requirements.

            (2) Enforcement authority.-- <<NOTE: Applicability.>> The 
        provisions of section 2736(b) of the Public Health Services Act

        limitation on the application of those provisions to group 
        health plans).

    (d) No Interference With State Regulatory Authority.--Nothing in 
this title shall be construed to preempt any State law that does not 
prevent the application of the provisions of this title.

        has insured a percentage of its population not less than the 
        percentage of the population projected to be covered nationally 
        after the implementation of this Act, that seeks to operate an 
        Exchange under this section, the Secretary shall presume that 
        such Exchange meets the standards under this section unless the 
        Secretary determines, after completion of the process 
        established under paragraph (2), that the Exchange does not 
        comply with such standards.
            (2) Process.--The Secretary shall establish a process to 
        work with a State described in paragraph (1) to provide 
        assistance necessary to assist the State's Exchange in coming 
        into compliance with the standards for approval under this 
        section.

                meeting its start-up costs; and
                    (B) grants to provide assistance to such person in 
                meeting any solvency requirements of States in which the 
                person seeks to be licensed to issue qualified health 
                plans.

                          (ii) give priority to applicants that will 
                      offer qualified health plans on a Statewide basis, 
                      will utilize integrated care models, and have

                      the establishment of multiple qualified nonprofit 
                      health insurance issuers in any State if the 
                      funding is sufficient to do so.
                    (B) States without issuers in program.--If no health 
                insurance issuer applies to be a qualified nonprofit 
                health insurance issuer within a State, the Secretary 
                may use amounts appropriated under this section for the 
                awarding of grants to encourage the establishment of a 
                qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer within the 
                State or the expansion of a qualified nonprofit health

                to the State with respect to the measures and standards, 
                and making the performance and quality information 
                available to enrollees in a useful form.
            (3) Enhanced availability.--
                    (A) Multiple plans.--A State shall, to the maximum 
                extent feasible, seek to make multiple standard health 
                plans available to eligible individuals within a State 
                to ensure individuals have a choice of such plans.
                    (B) Regional compacts.--A State may negotiate a 
                regional compact with other States to include coverage

            (4) Coordination with other state programs.--A State shall 
        seek to coordinate the administration of, and provision of

        State child health plan under title XXI of such Act, and other 
        State-administered health programs to maximize the efficiency of

        meets the requirements of the program established under 
        subsection (a), the Secretary shall transfer to the State for 
        each fiscal year for which 1 or more standard health plans are 
        operating within the State the amount determined under paragraph 
        (3).
            (2) Use of funds.--A State shall establish a trust for the

        individuals enrolled in standard health plans within the State. 
        Amounts in the trust fund, and expenditures of such amounts, 
        shall not be included in determining the amount of any non-
        Federal funds for purposes of meeting any matching or 
        expenditure requirement of any federally-funded program.
            (3) Amount of payment.--

                      Internal

[[Page 124 STAT. 202]]

                      Revenue Code of 1986, and the cost-sharing 
                      reductions under section 1402, that would have 
                      been provided for the fiscal year to eligible 
                      individuals enrolled in standard health plans in 
                      the State if such eligible individuals were 
                      allowed to enroll in qualified health plans 
                      through an Exchange established under this 
                      subtitle.
                          (ii) Specific requirements.--The Secretary 
                      shall make the determination under clause (i) on a 
                      per enrollee basis and shall take into account all 
                      relevant factors necessary to determine the value 
                      of the premium tax credits and cost-sharing 
                      reductions that would have been provided to 
                      eligible individuals described in clause (i), 
                      including the age and income of the enrollee, 
                      whether the enrollment is for self-only or family 
                      coverage, geographic differences in average 
                      spending for health care across rating areas, the 
                      health status of the enrollee for purposes of 
                      determining risk adjustment payments and 
                      reinsurance payments that would have been made if 
                      the enrollee had enrolled in a qualified health 
                      plan through an Exchange, and whether any 
                      reconciliation of the credit or cost-sharing 
                      reductions would have occurred if the enrollee had 
                      been so enrolled. This determination shall take 
                      into consideration the experience of other States 
                      with respect to participation in an Exchange and 
                      such credits and reductions provided to residents 
                      of the other States, with a special focus on 
                      enrollees with income below 200 percent of 
                      poverty.
                          (iii) Certification.--The Chief Actuary of the 
                      Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in

                      the Department of the Treasury, shall certify 
                      whether the methodology used to make 
                      determinations under this subparagraph, and such 
                      determinations, meet the requirements of clause 
                      (ii). Such certifications shall be based on 
                      sufficient data from the State and from comparable 
                      States about their experience with programs 
                      created by this Act.
                    (B) Corrections.--The Secretary shall adjust the 
                payment for any fiscal year to reflect any error in the 
                determinations under subparagraph (A) for any preceding 
                fiscal year.
            (4) Application of special rules.--The provisions of section 
        1303 shall apply to a State basic health program, and to 
        standard health plans offered through such program, in the same 
        manner as such rules apply to qualified health plans.

                      meaningful level of public input and that does not 
                      impose requirements that are in addition to, or 
                      duplicative of, requirements imposed under the

                waiver.
                    (B) Denial of waiver.--If the Secretary determines a 
                waiver should not be granted under subsection (a)(1), 
                the Secretary shall notify the State involved, and the 
                appropriate committees of Congress of such determination 
                and the reasons therefore.

    (e) <<NOTE: Deadline. Notification.>>  Term of Waiver.--No waiver 
under this section may extend over a period of longer than 5 years 
unless the State requests continuation of such waiver, and such request 
shall be deemed granted unless the Secretary, within 90 days after the 
date of its submission to the Secretary, either denies such request in 
writing or informs the State in writing with respect to any additional 
information which is needed in order to make a final determination with 
respect to the request.

                      addressing disputes as to the performance of the

                      resides;
                          (ii) would be required to be licensed in each 
                      State in which it offers the plan under the 
                      compact or to submit to the jurisdiction of each 
                      such State with regard to the standards described 
                      in clause (i) (including allowing access to 
                      records as if the insurer were licensed in the 
                      State); and
                          (iii) <<NOTE: Notification.>> must clearly 
                      notify consumers that the policy may not be 
                      subject to all the laws and regulations of the 
                      State in which the purchaser resides.
            (2) State authority.--A State may not enter into an 
        agreement under this subsection unless the State enacts a law

            (3) Approval of compacts.--The Secretary may approve 
        interstate health care choice compacts under paragraph (1)

        only if the Secretary determines that such health care choice 
        compact--
                    (A) will provide coverage that is at least as 
                comprehensive as the coverage defined in section 1302(b) 
                and offered through Exchanges established under this 
                title;
                    (B) will provide coverage and cost sharing 
                protections against excessive out-of-pocket spending

                this title would provide;
                    (C) will provide coverage to at least a comparable 
                number of its residents as the provisions of this title 
                would provide;
                    (D) will not increase the Federal deficit; and
                    (E) will not weaken enforcement of laws and 
                regulations described in paragraph (1)(B)(i) in any 
                State that is included in such compact.
            (4) Effective date.--A health care choice compact described 
        in paragraph (1) shall not take effect before January 1, 2016.

    (b) Authority for Nationwide Plans.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), if an 
        issuer (including a group of health insurance issuers affiliated 
        either by common ownership and control or by the common use of a 
        nationally licensed service mark) of a qualified health plan in 
        the individual or small group market meets the requirements of 
        this subsection (in this subsection a ``nationwide qualified 
        health plan'')--
                    (A) the issuer of the plan may offer the nationwide 
                qualified health plan in the individual or small group 
                market in more than 1 State; and
                    (B) <<NOTE: Applicability.>> with respect to State 
                laws mandating benefit coverage by a health plan, only 
                the State laws of the State in which such plan is 
                written or issued shall apply to the nationwide 
                qualified health plan.
            (2) State opt-out.--A State may, by specific reference in a 
        law enacted after the date of enactment of this title, provide 
        that this subsection shall not apply to that State. Such opt-out 
        shall be effective until such time as the State by law revokes 
        it.
            (3) Plan requirements.--An issuer meets the requirements of 
        this subsection with respect to a nationwide qualified health 
        plan if, in the determination of the Secretary--
                    (A) the plan offers a benefits package that is 
                uniform in each State in which the plan is offered and 
                meets the requirements set forth in paragraphs (4) 
                through (6);
                    (B) the issuer is licensed in each State in which it 
                offers the plan and is subject to all requirements of 
                State law not inconsistent with this section, including 
                but not limited to, the standards and requirements that 
                a State imposes that do not prevent the application of a 
                requirement of part A of title XXVII of the Public 
                Health Service Act or a requirement of this title;
                    (C) the issuer meets all requirements of this title 
                with respect to a qualified health plan, including the 
                requirement to offer the silver and gold levels of the 
                plan in each Exchange in the State for the market in 
                which the plan is offered;

[[Page 124 STAT. 208]]

                    (D) the issuer determines the premiums for the plan 
                in any State on the basis of the rating rules in effect 
                in that State for the rating areas in which it is 
                offered;
                    (E) the issuer offers the nationwide qualified 
                health plan in at least 60 percent of the participating 
                States in the first year in which the plan is offered, 
                65 percent of such States in the second year, 70 percent 
                of such States in the third year, 75 percent of such 
                States in the fourth year, and 80 percent of such States 
                in the fifth and subsequent years;
                    (F) the issuer shall offer the plan in participating 
                States across the country, in all geographic regions, 
                and in all States that have adopted adjusted community 
                rating before the date of enactment of this Act; and
                    (G) the issuer clearly notifies consumers that the 
                policy may not contain some benefits otherwise mandated 
                for plans in the State in which the purchaser resides 
                and provides a detailed statement of the benefits 
                offered and the benefit differences in that State, in 
                accordance with rules promulgated by the Secretary.
            (4) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Form review for nationwide plans.--
        Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law, at least 3 
        months before any nationwide qualified health plan is offered, 
        the issuer shall file all nationwide qualified health plan forms 
        with the regulator in each participating State in which the plan 
        will be offered. An issuer may appeal the disapproval of a 
        nationwide qualified health plan form to the Secretary.
            (5) Applicable rules.--The Secretary shall, in consultation 
        with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, issue 
        rules for the offering of nationwide qualified health plans 
        under this subsection. Nationwide qualified health plans may be 
        offered only after such rules have taken effect.
            (6) Coverage.--The Secretary shall provide that the health 
        benefits coverage provided to an individual through a nationwide 
        qualified health plan under this subsection shall include at 
        least the essential benefits package described in section 1302.
            (7) State law mandating benefit coverage by a health 
        benefits plan.--For the purposes of this subsection, a State law 
        mandating benefit coverage by a health plan is a law that 
        mandates health insurance coverage or the offer of health 
        insurance coverage for specific health services or specific 
        diseases. A law that mandates health insurance coverage or 
        reimbursement for services provided by certain classes of 
        providers of health care services, or a law that mandates that 
        certain classes of individuals must be covered as a group or as 
        dependents, is not a State law mandating benefit coverage by a 
        health benefits plan.

                 PART V--REINSURANCE AND RISK ADJUSTMENT

SEC. 1341. <<NOTE: 42 USC 18061.>>  TRANSITIONAL REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR 
            INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS IN EACH STATE.

    (a) In General <<NOTE: Deadline.>> .--Each State shall, not later 
than January 1, 2014--

[[Page 124 STAT. 209]]

            (1) include in the Federal standards or State law or 
        regulation the State adopts and has in effect under section 
        1321(b) the provisions described in subsection (b); and
            (2) <<NOTE: Contracts.>> establish (or enter into a contract 
        with) 1 or more applicable reinsurance entities to carry out the 
        reinsurance program under this section.

    (b) Model Regulation.--
            (1) In general.--In establishing the Federal standards under 
        section 1321(a), the Secretary, in consultation with the 
        National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the ``NAIC''), 
        shall include provisions that enable States to establish and 
        maintain a program under which--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Effective date. Time period.>> health 
                insurance issuers, and third party administrators on 
                behalf of group health plans, are required to make 
                payments to an applicable reinsurance entity for any 
                plan year beginning in the 3-year period beginning 
                January 1, 2014 (as specified in paragraph (3); and
                    (B) the applicable reinsurance entity collects 
                payments under subparagraph (A) and uses amounts so 
                collected to make reinsurance payments to health 
                insurance issuers described in subparagraph (A) that 
                cover high risk individuals in the individual market 
                (excluding grandfathered health plans) for any plan year 
                beginning in such 3-year period.
            (2) High-risk individual; payment amounts.--The Secretary 
        shall include the following in the provisions under paragraph 
        (1):
                    (A) Determination of high-risk individuals.--The 
                method by which individuals will be identified as high 
                risk individuals for purposes of the reinsurance program 
                established under this section. Such method shall 
                provide for identification of individuals as high-risk 
                individuals on the basis of--
                          (i) a list of at least 50 but not more than 
                      100 medical conditions that are identified as 
                      high-risk conditions and that may be based on the 
                      identification of diagnostic and procedure codes 
                      that are indicative of individuals with pre-
                      existing, high-risk conditions; or
                          (ii) any other comparable objective method of 
                      identification recommended by the American Academy 
                      of Actuaries.
                    (B) Payment amount.--The formula for determining the 
                amount of payments that will be paid to health insurance 
                issuers described in paragraph (1)(A) that insure high-
                risk individuals. Such formula shall provide for the 
                equitable allocation of available funds through 
                reconciliation and may be designed--
                          (i) to provide a schedule of payments that 
                      specifies the amount that will be paid for each of 
                      the conditions identified under subparagraph (A); 
                      or
                          (ii) to use any other comparable method for 
                      determining payment amounts that is recommended by 
                      the American Academy of Actuaries and that 
                      encourages the use of care coordination and care 
                      management programs for high risk conditions.
            (3) Determination of required contributions.--

[[Page 124 STAT. 210]]

                    (A) In general <<NOTE: Effective date. Time 
                period.>> .--The Secretary shall include in the 
                provisions under paragraph (1) the method for 
                determining the amount each health insurance issuer and 
                group health plan described in paragraph (1)(A) 
                contributing to the reinsurance program under this 
                section is required to contribute under such paragraph 
                for each plan year beginning in the 36-month period 
                beginning January 1, 2014. The contribution amount for 
                any plan year may be based on the percentage of revenue 
                of each issuer and the total costs of providing benefits 
                to enrollees in self-insured plans or on a specified 
                amount per enrollee and may be required to be paid in 
                advance or periodically throughout the plan year.
                    (B) Specific requirements.--The method under this 
                paragraph shall be designed so that--
                          (i) the contribution amount for each issuer 
                      proportionally reflects each issuer's fully 
                      insured commercial book of business for all major 
                      medical products and the total value of all fees 
                      charged by the issuer and the costs of coverage 
                      administered by the issuer as a third party 
                      administrator;
                          (ii) the contribution amount can include an 
                      additional amount to fund the administrative 
                      expenses of the applicable reinsurance entity;
                          (iii) the aggregate contribution amounts for 
                      all States shall, based on the best estimates of 
                      the NAIC and without regard to amounts described 
                      in clause (ii), equal $10,000,000,000 for plan 
                      years beginning in 2014, $6,000,000,000 for plan 
                      years beginning 2015, and $4,000,000,000 for plan 
                      years beginning in 2016; and
                          (iv) in addition to the aggregate contribution 
                      amounts under clause (iii), each issuer's 
                      contribution amount for any calendar year under 
                      clause (iii) reflects its proportionate share of 
                      an additional $2,000,000,000 for 2014, an 
                      additional $2,000,000,000 for 2015, and an 
                      additional $1,000,000,000 for 2016.
                Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to 
                preclude a State from collecting additional amounts from 
                issuers on a voluntary basis.
            (4) Expenditure of funds.--The provisions under paragraph 
        (1) shall provide that--
                    (A) the contribution amounts collected for any 
                calendar year may be allocated and used in any of the 
                three calendar years for which amounts are collected 
                based on the reinsurance needs of a particular period or 
                to reflect experience in a prior period; and
                    (B) <<NOTE: Time period. Effective date.>> amounts 
                remaining unexpended as of December, 2016, may be used 
                to make payments under any reinsurance program of a 
                State in the individual market in effect in the 2-year 
                period beginning on January 1, 2017.
        Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any contribution amounts 
        described in paragraph (3)(B)(iv) shall be deposited into the 
        general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be 
        used for the program established under this section.

[[Page 124 STAT. 211]]

    (c) Applicable Reinsurance Entity.--For purposes of this section--
            (1) In general.-- <<NOTE: Definition.>> The term 
        ``applicable reinsurance entity'' means a not-for-profit 
        organization--
                    (A) the purpose of which is to help stabilize 
                premiums for coverage in the individual and small group 
                markets in a State during the first 3 years of operation 
                of an Exchange for such markets within the State when 
                the risk of adverse selection related to new rating 
                rules and market changes is greatest; and
                    (B) the duties of which shall be to carry out the 
                reinsurance program under this section by coordinating

                    (A) In general.--The reduction in cost-sharing under 
                this subsection shall first be achieved by reducing the 
                applicable out-of pocket limit under section 1302(c)(1) 
                in the case of--
                          (i) an eligible insured whose household income

                      percent of the poverty line for a family of the 
                      size involved, by two-thirds;
                          (ii) an eligible insured whose household 
                      income is more than 200 percent but not more than

                    (B) Coordination with actuarial value limits.--
                          (i) In general.--The Secretary shall ensure 
                      the reduction under this paragraph shall not

                      total allowed costs of benefits provided under the 
                      plan above--
                                    (I) 90 percent in the case of an 
                                eligible insured described in paragraph 
                                (2)(A);

                                (2)(B); and
                                    (III) 70 percent in the case of an 
                                eligible insured described in clause

                      the out-of pocket limits under paragraph (1) if 
                      necessary to ensure that such limits do not cause 
                      the respective actuarial values to exceed the 
                      levels specified in clause (i).
            (2) Additional reduction for lower income insureds.--
        The <<NOTE: Procedures.>> Secretary shall establish procedures 
        under which the issuer of a qualified health plan to which this 
        section applies shall further reduce cost-sharing under the plan 
        in a manner sufficient to--
                    (A) in the case of an eligible insured whose 
                household income is not less than 100 percent but not 
                more than 150 percent of the poverty line for a family 
                of the size involved, increase the plan's share of the 
                total allowed

[[Page 124 STAT. 222]]

                costs of benefits provided under the plan to 90 percent 
                of such costs; and
                    (B) in the case of an eligible insured whose 
                household income is more than 150 percent but not more 
                than 200 percent of the poverty line for a family of the 
                size involved, increase the plan's share of the total 
                allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan to 80 
                percent of such costs.
            (3) Methods for reducing cost-sharing.--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Notification.>>  In general.--An issuer 
                of a qualified health plan making reductions under this 
                subsection shall notify the Secretary of such reductions 
                and the Secretary shall make periodic and timely 
                payments to the issuer equal to the value of the 
                reductions.
                    (B) Capitated payments.--The Secretary may establish 
                a capitated payment system to carry out the payment of 
                cost-sharing reductions under this section. Any such 
                system shall take into account the value of the 
                reductions and make appropriate risk adjustments to such 
                payments.
            (4) Additional benefits.--If a qualified health plan under 
        section 1302(b)(5) offers benefits in addition to the essential 
        health benefits required to be provided by the plan, or a State 
        requires a qualified health plan under section 1311(d)(3)(B) to 
        cover benefits in addition to the essential health benefits 
        required to be provided by the plan, the reductions in cost-
        sharing under this section shall not apply to such additional 
        benefits.
            (5) Special rule for pediatric dental plans.--If an 
        individual enrolls in both a qualified health plan and a plan 
        described in section 1311(d)(2)(B)(ii)(I) for any plan year, 
        subsection (a) shall not apply to that portion of any reduction 
        in cost-sharing under subsection (c) that (under regulations 
        prescribed by the Secretary) is properly allocable to pediatric 
        dental benefits which are included in the essential health 
        benefits required to be provided by a qualified health plan 
        under section 1302(b)(1)(J).

    (d) Special Rules for Indians.--
            (1) Indians under 300 percent of poverty.--If an individual 
        enrolled in any qualified health plan in the individual market 
        through an Exchange is an Indian (as defined in section 4(d) of 
        the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 
        U.S.C. 450b(d))) whose household income is not more than 300 
        percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved, 
        then, for purposes of this section--
                    (A) such individual shall be treated as an eligible 
                insured; and
                    (B) the issuer of the plan shall eliminate any cost-
                sharing under the plan.
            (2) Items or services furnished through indian health 
        providers.--If an Indian (as so defined) enrolled in a qualified 
        health plan is furnished an item or service directly by the 
        Indian Health Service, an Indian Tribe, Tribal Organization, or 
        Urban Indian Organization or through referral under contract 
        health services--
                    (A) no cost-sharing under the plan shall be imposed 
                under the plan for such item or service; and
                    (B) the issuer of the plan shall not reduce the 
                payment to any such entity for such item or service by 
                the amount

[[Page 124 STAT. 223]]

                of any cost-sharing that would be due from the Indian 
                but for subparagraph (A).
            (3) Payment.--The Secretary shall pay to the issuer of a 
        qualified health plan the amount necessary to reflect the 
        increase in actuarial value of the plan required by reason of 
        this subsection.

    (e) Rules for Individuals Not Lawfully Present.--
            (1) In general.--If an individual who is an eligible insured 
        is not lawfully present--
                    (A) no cost-sharing reduction under this section 
                shall apply with respect to the individual; and
                    (B) for purposes of applying this section, the 
                determination as to what percentage a taxpayer's 
                household income bears to the poverty level for a family 
                of the size involved shall be made under one of the 
                following methods:
                          (i) A method under which--
                                    (I) the taxpayer's family size is 
                                determined by not taking such 
                                individuals into account, and
                                    (II) the taxpayer's household income 
                                is equal to the product of the 
                                taxpayer's household income (determined 
                                without regard to this subsection) and a 
                                fraction--
                                            (aa) the numerator of which 
                                        is the poverty line for the 
                                        taxpayer's family size 
                                        determined after application of 
                                        subclause (I), and
                                            (bb) the denominator of 
                                        which is the poverty line for 
                                        the taxpayer's family size 
                                        determined without regard to 
                                        subclause (I).
                          (ii) A comparable method reaching the same 
                      result as the method under clause (i).
            (2) Lawfully present.--For purposes of this section, an 
        individual shall be treated as lawfully present only if the

        this section is being claimed, a citizen or national of the

            (3) <<NOTE: Regulations.>>  Secretarial authority.--The 
        Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, 
        shall prescribe rules setting forth the methods by which 
        calculations of family size and household income are made for 
        purposes of this subsection. Such rules shall be designed to 
        ensure that the least burden is placed on individuals enrolling

                      of the information, and by taking such additional 
                      actions as the Secretary, through regulation or

                separate appeals process for employers who are notified 
                under subsection (e)(4)(C) that the employer may be 
                liable for a tax imposed by section 4980H of the 
                Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to an 
                employee because of a determination that the employer 
                does not provide minimum essential coverage through an 
                employer-sponsored plan or that the employer does 
                provide that coverage but it is not affordable coverage 
                with respect to an employee. Such process shall provide

                      State health subsidy programs within the State;
                          (ii) may be filed online, in person, by mail,

                household income (as defined in section 36B of the 
                Internal Revenue Code of 1986).

                                in paragraph (3) to applicable State

                    (C) consistent with standards promulgated by the 
                Secretary, including the privacy and data security 
                safeguards described in section 1942 of the Social 
                Security Act or that are otherwise applicable to such 
                programs.

                      of reliable, third party data, including 
                      information described in sections 1137, 453(i), 
                      and 1942(a) of the Social Security Act, obtained 
                      through such arrangement.
                    (B) Exception.--This paragraph shall not apply in 
                circumstances with respect to which the Secretary 
                determines that the administrative and other costs of 
                use of the data matching arrangement under paragraph (2) 
                outweigh its expected gains in accuracy, efficiency, and 
                program participation.
            (4) Secretarial standards.--The Secretary shall, after 
        consultation with persons in possession of the data to be 
        matched and representatives of applicable State health subsidy 
        programs, promulgate standards governing the timing, contents, 
        and procedures for data matching described in this subsection. 
        Such standards shall take into account administrative and other 
        costs and the value of data matching to the establishment, 
        verification, and updating of eligibility for applicable State 
        health subsidy programs.

    (d) Administrative Authority.--
            (1) Agreements.--Subject to section 1411 and section 
        6103(l)(21) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and any other 
        requirement providing safeguards of privacy and data integrity, 
        the Secretary may establish model agreements, and enter into 
        agreements, for the sharing of data under this section.
            (2) Authority of exchange to contract out.--Nothing in this 
        section shall be construed to--
                    (A) prohibit contractual arrangements through which 
                a State medicaid agency determines eligibility for all 
                applicable State health subsidy programs, but only if 
                such agency complies with the Secretary's requirements 
                ensuring reduced administrative costs, eligibility 
                errors, and disruptions in coverage; or
                    (B) change any requirement under title XIX that 
                eligibility for participation in a State's medicaid 
                program must be determined by a public agency.

    (e) Applicable State Health Subsidy Program.--In this section, the 
term ``applicable State health subsidy program'' means--
            (1) the program under this title for the enrollment in 
        qualified health plans offered through an Exchange, including

eligible small employer, the small employer health insurance credit 
determined under this section for any taxable year in the credit period 
is the amount determined under subsection (b).
    ``(b) Health Insurance Credit Amount.--Subject to subsection (c), 
the amount determined under this subsection with respect to any eligible 
small employer is equal to 50 percent (35 percent in the case of a tax-
exempt eligible small employer) of the lesser of--
            ``(1) the aggregate amount of nonelective contributions the 
        employer made on behalf of its employees during the taxable year 
        under the arrangement described in subsection (d)(4) for

        a premium equal to the average premium (as determined by the 
        Secretary of Health and Human Services) for the small group 
        market in the rating area in which the employee enrolls for 
        coverage.

    ``(c) Phaseout of Credit Amount Based on Number of Employees and 
Average Wages.--The amount of the credit determined under subsection (b) 
without regard to this subsection shall be reduced (but not below zero) 
by the sum of the following amounts:
            ``(1) Such amount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of 
        which is the total number of full-time equivalent employees of 
        the employer in excess of 10 and the denominator of which is 15.

        which is the average annual wages of the employer in excess of 
        the dollar amount in effect under subsection (d)(3)(B) and the 
        denominator of which is such dollar amount.

            Subtitle F--Shared Responsibility for Health Care

                    PART I--INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY

SEC. 1501. <<NOTE: 42 USC 18091.>>  REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM 
            ESSENTIAL COVERAGE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In general.--The individual responsibility requirement 
        provided for in this section (in this subsection referred to as 
        the ``requirement'') is commercial and economic in nature, and 
        substantially affects interstate commerce, as a result of the 
        effects described in paragraph (2).

[[Page 124 STAT. 243]]

            (2) Effects on the national economy and interstate 
        commerce.--The effects described in this paragraph are the 
        following:
                    (A) The requirement regulates activity that is 
                commercial and economic in nature: economic and 
                financial decisions about how and when health care is 
                paid for, and when health insurance is purchased.
                    (B) Health insurance and health care services are a 
                significant part of the national economy. National 
                health spending is projected to increase from 
                $2,500,000,000,000, or 17.6 percent of the economy, in 
                2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in 2019. Private health 
                insurance spending is projected to be $854,000,000,000 
                in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, drugs, and 
                equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. Since 
                most health insurance is sold by national or regional 
                health insurance companies, health insurance is sold in 
                interstate commerce and claims payments flow through 
                interstate commerce.
                    (C) The requirement, together with the other 
                provisions of this Act, will add millions of new 
                consumers to the health insurance market, increasing the 
                supply of, and demand for, health care services. 
                According to the Congressional Budget Office, the 
                requirement will increase the number and share of 
                Americans who are insured.
                    (D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage 
                by building upon and strengthening the private employer-
                based health insurance system, which covers 176,000,000 
                Americans nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar 
                requirement has strengthened private employer-based 
                coverage: despite the economic downturn, the number of 
                workers offered employer-based coverage has actually 
                increased.
                    (E) Half of all personal bankruptcies are caused in 
                part by medical expenses. By significantly increasing 
                health insurance coverage, the requirement, together 
                with the other provisions of this Act, will improve 
                financial security for families.
                    (F) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security 
                Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health 
                Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the 
                Federal Government has a significant role in regulating 
                health insurance which is in interstate commerce.
                    (G) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public 
                Health Service Act (as added by section 1201 of this 
                Act), if there were no requirement, many individuals 
                would wait to purchase health insurance until they 
                needed care. By significantly increasing health 
                insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the 
                other provisions of this Act, will minimize this adverse 
                selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to 
                include healthy individuals, which will lower health 
                insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to 
                creating effective health insurance markets in which 
                improved health insurance products that are guaranteed 
                issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-existing 
                conditions can be sold.
                    (H) Administrative costs for private health 
                insurance, which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 
                30 percent of premiums in the current individual and 
                small group

[[Page 124 STAT. 244]]

                markets. By significantly increasing health insurance 
                coverage and the size of purchasing pools, which will 
                increase economies of scale, the requirement, together 
                with the other provisions of this Act, will 
                significantly reduce administrative costs and lower 
                health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential 
                to creating effective health insurance markets that do 
                not require underwriting and eliminate its associated 
                administrative costs.
            (3) Supreme court ruling.--In United States v. South-Eastern 
        Underwriters Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the Supreme 
        Court of the United States ruled that insurance is interstate 
        commerce subject to Federal regulation.

    (b) In General.--Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is 
amended by adding at the end the following new chapter:

         ``CHAPTER 48--MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE

``Sec. 5000A. Requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.

        determined under subsection (c).

                penalty.

    ``(c) Amount of Penalty.--
            ``(1) In general.--The penalty determined under this

            ``(2) Dollar limitation.--The amount of the penalty imposed

SEC. 1563. SENSE OF THE SENATE PROMOTING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, 
        this Act will reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019.
            (2) CBO projects this Act will continue to reduce budget 
        deficits after 2019.

[[Page 124 STAT. 271]]

            (3) Based on CBO estimates, this Act will extend the 
        solvency of the Medicare HI Trust Fund.
            (4) This Act will increase the surplus in the Social 
        Security Trust Fund, which should be reserved to strengthen the 
        finances of Social Security.
            (5) The initial net savings generated by the Community 
        Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program are 
        necessary to ensure the long-term solvency of that program.

    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the additional surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund 
        generated by this Act should be reserved for Social Security and 
        not spent in this Act for other purposes; and
            (2) the net savings generated by the CLASS program should be 
        reserved for the CLASS program and not spent in this Act for 
        other purposes.

        receiving non-institutionally-based long-term services and 
        supports (including such services and supports that are provided

SEC. 2406. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LONG-TERM CARE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Nearly 2 decades have passed since Congress seriously 
        considered long-term care reform. The United States Bipartisan 
        Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, also know as the 
        ``Pepper Commission'', released its ``Call for Action'' 
        blueprint for health reform in September 1990. In the 20 years 
        since those recommendations were made, Congress has never acted 
        on the report.
            (2) In 1999, under the United States Supreme Court's 
        decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), individuals

[[Page 124 STAT. 306]]

        with disabilities have the right to choose to receive their 
        long-term services and supports in the community, rather than in 
        an institutional setting.
            (3) Despite the Pepper Commission and Olmstead decision, the 
        long-term care provided to our Nation's elderly and disabled has 
        not improved. In fact, for many, it has gotten far worse.
            (4) In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term care spending 
        for elderly individuals and adults with physical disabilities 
        paid for institutional services. Only 6 states spent 50 percent 
        or more of their Medicaid long-term care dollars on home and 
        community-based services for elderly individuals and adults with 
        physical disabilities while \1/2\ of the States spent less than 
        25 percent. This disparity continues even though, on average, it 
        is estimated that Medicaid dollars can support nearly 3 elderly 
        individuals and adults with physical disabilities in home and 
        community-based services for every individual in a nursing home. 
        Although every State has chosen to provide certain services

        need; and
            (2) long term services and supports should be made available

SEC. 2704. <<NOTE: 42 USC 1396a note.>> DEMONSTRATION PROJECT TO 
            EVALUATE INTEGRATED CARE AROUND A HOSPITALIZATION.

    (a) Authority To Conduct Project.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
        (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall 
        establish a demonstration project under title XIX of the Social 
        Security Act to evaluate the use of bundled payments for the 
        provision of integrated care for a Medicaid beneficiary--
                    (A) with respect to an episode of care that includes 
                a hospitalization; and
                    (B) for concurrent physicians services provided 
                during a hospitalization.
            (2) Duration.--The demonstration project shall begin on 
        January 1, 2012, and shall end on December 31, 2016.

    (b) Requirements.--The demonstration project shall be conducted in 
accordance with the following:
            (1) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  The demonstration project 
        shall be conducted in up to 8 States, determined by the 
        Secretary based on consideration of the potential to lower costs 
        under the Medicaid program while improving care for Medicaid 
        beneficiaries. A State selected to participate in the 
        demonstration project may target the demonstration project to 
        particular categories of beneficiaries, beneficiaries with 
        particular diagnoses, or particular geographic regions of the 
        State, but the Secretary shall insure that, as a whole, the 
        demonstration project is, to the greatest extent possible, 
        representative of the demographic and geographic composition of 
        Medicaid beneficiaries nationally.
            (2) The demonstration project shall focus on conditions 
        where there is evidence of an opportunity for providers of 
        services and suppliers to improve the quality of care furnished 
        to Medicaid beneficiaries while reducing total expenditures 
        under the State Medicaid programs selected to participate, as 
        determined by the Secretary.
            (3) A State selected to participate in the demonstration 
        project shall specify the 1 or more episodes of care the State 
        proposes to address in the project, the services to be included 
        in the bundled payments, and the rationale for the selection of 
        such episodes of care and services. The Secretary may modify the 
        episodes of care as well as the services to be included in the 
        bundled payments prior to or after approving the project. The 
        Secretary may also vary such factors among the different States 
        participating in the demonstration project.
            (4) The Secretary shall ensure that payments made under the 
        demonstration project are adjusted for severity of illness and 
        other characteristics of Medicaid beneficiaries within a 
        category or having a diagnosis targeted as part of the 
        demonstration project. States shall ensure that Medicaid 
        beneficiaries are not liable for any additional cost sharing 
        than

[[Page 124 STAT. 324]]

        if their care had not been subject to payment under the 
        demonstration project.
            (5) Hospitals participating in the demonstration project 
        shall have or establish robust discharge planning programs to 
        ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries requiring post-acute care are 
        appropriately placed in, or have ready access to, post-acute 
        care settings.
            (6) The Secretary and each State selected to participate in 
        the demonstration project shall ensure that the demonstration 
        project does not result in the Medicaid beneficiaries whose care 
        is subject to payment under the demonstration project being 
        provided with less items and services for which medical 
        assistance is provided under the State Medicaid program than the 
        items and services for which medical assistance would have been 
        provided to such beneficiaries under the State Medicaid program 
        in the absence of the demonstration project.

    (c) Waiver of Provisions.--Notwithstanding section 1115(a) of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315(a)), the Secretary may waive such 
provisions of titles XIX, XVIII, and XI of that Act as may be necessary 
to accomplish the goals of the demonstration, ensure beneficiary access 
to acute and post-acute care, and maintain quality of care.
    (d) Evaluation and Report.--
            (1) Data.--Each State selected to participate in the 
        demonstration project under this section shall provide to the 
        Secretary, in such form and manner as the Secretary shall 
        specify, relevant data necessary to monitor outcomes, costs, and 
        quality, and evaluate the rationales for selection of the 
        episodes of care and services specified by States under 
        subsection (b)(3).
            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the conclusion of 
        the demonstration project, the Secretary shall submit a report 
        to Congress on the results of the demonstration project.

        individuals.
            (2) Savings requirement.--A participating State, in 
        consultation with the Secretary, shall establish an annual

                coordinated national campaign to increase the awareness

                carrying the pregnancy to term and parenting the child, 
                carrying the pregnancy to term and placing the child for 
                adoption, miscarriage, and having an abortion. This 
                study may assess the incidence, timing, magnitude, and 
                duration of the immediate and long-term mental health 
                consequences (positive or negative) of these pregnancy 
                outcomes.

                under subsection (a), beginning not later than 5 years 
                after the date of the enactment of this Act, and 
                periodically

        covered under parts A and B furnished to applicable 
        beneficiaries for each qualifying independence at home medical 
        practice under this section. Such spending targets shall be 
        determined on a per capita basis. Such spending targets shall 
        include a risk corridor that takes into account normal variation 
        in expenditures for items and services covered under parts A and 
        B furnished to such beneficiaries with the size of the corridor 
        being related to the number of applicable beneficiaries 
        furnished services by each independence at home medical 
        practice. The spending targets may also be adjusted for other 
        factors as the Secretary determines appropriate.
            ``(2) Incentive payments.--Subject to performance on quality 
        measures, a qualifying independence at home medical practice is 
        eligible to receive an incentive payment under this section if 
        actual expenditures for a year for the applicable beneficiaries 
        it enrolls are less than the estimated spending target 
        established under paragraph (1) for such year. An incentive 
        payment for such year shall be equal to a portion (as determined 
        by the Secretary) of the amount by which actual expenditures 
        (including incentive payments under this paragraph) for 
        applicable beneficiaries under parts A and B for such year are 
        estimated to be less than 5 percent less than the estimated

                    (A) population density and relative patient access 
                to care;

        Secretary shall collect additional data and information as the 
        Secretary determines appropriate to revise payments for hospice

        other purposes as determined appropriate by the 
        Secretary. <<NOTE: Deadline.>> The Secretary shall begin to 
        collect such data by not later than January 1, 2011.

        for routine home care and other services included in hospice 
        care under this part, as the Secretary determines to be 
        appropriate. Such revisions may be based on an analysis of data 
        and information collected under subparagraph (A). Such revisions 
        may include adjustments to per diem payments that reflect 
        changes in resource intensity in providing such care and

        care.

        the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission regarding the

        establishing a new hospital compensation index system that--

                applying such adjustments;
                    (D) takes into account the effect that 
                implementation of the system would have on health care 
                providers and on each region of the country;

[[Page 124 STAT. 439]]

                    (E) addresses issues related to occupational mix, 
                such as staffing practices and ratios, and any evidence

                XVIII of such Act.

    (b) Report.--Not later than 9 months after the date of enactment of
